    <h1> Mid-Autumn Festival</h1> 
    <h5> Jason H. </h5>
    <p>The Mid-Autumn Festival also known as the Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival, is a traditional festival celebrated in Chinese culture. 

It is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture; its popularity is on par with that of Chinese New Year. The history of the Mid-Autumn Festival dates back over 3,000 years. The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunar calendar with a full moon at night,or about mid-September to early October. 

Lanterns of all size and shapes, are carried and displayed â€“ symbolic beacons that light people's path to prosperity and good fortune. Mooncakes, a rich pastry typically filled with sweet-bean, egg yolk, meat or lotus-seed paste, are traditionally eaten during this festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is based on the legend of Chang'e, the Moon goddess in Chinese mythology.</p>
